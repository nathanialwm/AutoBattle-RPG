# AutoBattle-RPG
A short autobattling, incremental RPG in pygame
If this is still in progress, test branch is likely more up to date

The game is now playable but lacking some features, such as tutorials and drop_chance stats from equipments

This game is a short and simple autobattling text rpg. There will be 10 enemies, an equipment system and a secret type of item as an easter egg for those achievement hunters.
The main goals of this project are to familiarize myself with pygame and learn and practice balancing a game with combat.
