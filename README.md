# AutoBattle-RPG
A short autobattling, incremental RPG in pygame

For now all files and modules used are necessary to run this game. Once I complete all base game features I will create a venv and executable.

This game is a short and simple autobattling text rpg. There will be 10 enemies, an equipment system and a secret type of item as an easter egg for those achievement hunters.
The main goals of this project are to familiarize myself with pygame and learn and practice balancing a game with combat.
